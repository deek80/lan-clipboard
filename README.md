I want to run a tiny server on a raspberry pi or similar that acts as a clipboard
for any computer on our lan. Initially there won't be any clients, but you could
easily make one with curl or similar for linux. Android might be slightly trickier,
but in theory making a simple http call shouldn't be hard. Also, initially it's only
going to support text. My main use case that I can think of is sharing URLs between
my phone and my computer, or my phone and my wife's phone, etc.
